"Many Assets x Many Games"

The Isekai Alliance Protocol is an initiative to enhance interoperability in fully on-chain Web3 games. This project comprises three foundational sub-projects:

The "Many Assets" Layer: Introducing Itembox
Itembox is an open-source tool designed for indie developers to define and manage game assets through Blueprints and Recipes. 
It facilitates asset interoperability in fully-onchain games, allowing collaboration between developers and even extending to tabletop communities like DnD, where players can create and share custom assets.

The "x (Cross)" Layer: Isekai Crossover Specification
This layer provides a unified interface, called the Isekai Crossover Specification, enabling seamless integration across different games. It sets standards for how game developers can incorporate assets and features from other games into their own.

The "Many Games" Layer: DeezQuest: Trinexus
To demonstrate the potential of this protocol, we’re starting with DeezQuest: Trinexus—the first fully on-chain game that leverages the previous two layers, showcasing the real power of asset and game interoperability.

All of these sub-projects are completely open source, supporting a collaborative ecosystem.

We aim to make genuine interoperability in gaming a reality, unlocking new possibilities for both developers and players.
